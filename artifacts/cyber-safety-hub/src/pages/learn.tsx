        id: 3,
        question: "What is 'Spear Phishing'?",
        options: [

          "No, it means the site is currently being hacked."
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "Scammers often use HTTPS to create a false sense of security. It encrypts data but doesn't prove who owns the site."
